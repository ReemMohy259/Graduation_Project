### **UDS Tester Tool ðŸš—ðŸ”§**  
This project is our **graduation project** as students at **Cairo University**, designed to communicate with vehicle ECUs using the **Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol (ISO 14229-1)**. It enables sending diagnostic requests, reading DTCs, performing ECU resets, security access, and firmware flashing. Built in **Java (OOP)** with **JUnit testing** and a **custom logging system**. Future enhancements include **CAN bus integration** and **GUI development**. ðŸš€
